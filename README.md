************************* CODING PROBLEM *******************************************************************

Part I 

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones (from Wikipedia).  The sequence appears as follows: 

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,... 

The 0th number of the series(f0) is 0, f1=1, f2=1, f3=2, etc. 

Write two functions, preferably in C or C++, that both take an integer n and return the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence, i.e. fib(1) should return 1 and fib(10) should return 55.  

  - One function should implement a recursive algorithm, 
  - One should implement an iterative algorithm.

Expect inputs up to n=100. Please ensure code can be compiled and provide code files and header files if needed.

Treat this problem as if the code is to be released to production and include anything you think is appropriate. 



************************** IMPLEMENTATION AND DISCUSSIONS **************************************************

Part II 

From your implementation of the above two functions (recursive and iterative), which would you use in an actual release?  For the version you wouldn’t choose, please include your reasons why you wouldn’t use it. 

Is there any situation you can think of where you would use the ‘bad’ version? (might need to be a little creative here) 

Part III (optional) 

If you’re still enjoying this - what would you do to optimize the code? (think both for a single function call as well as over the long term)  

What’s the cost for doing so?
